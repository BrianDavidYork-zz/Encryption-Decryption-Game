ENCODER/DECODER

DESCRIPTION:
	This program allows users to choose between two difficulty levels. Within each level they can choose to practice 	encoding and decoding, or they can choose to take a test. The two levels use different methods of encryption. Level 1 uses Caesar encryption, level 2 uses Vigenere encryption. The program consists of 3 files--the main program (Encoder-Decoder.py), a file containing all of the code for level 1 (Caesar.py), and a file containing all of the code for level 2 (Vigenere.py).
