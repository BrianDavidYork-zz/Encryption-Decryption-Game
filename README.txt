ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION GAME

DESCRIPTION:
	This program allows users to choose between four difficulty levels. Within each level they can choose to practice 	encoding and decoding, or they can choose to take a test. The four levels all use different ciphering methods for encrypting the text. Level 1 uses Reverse encryption, level 2 uses a Caesar encryption, level 3 uses a Vigenere encryption, and level 4 uses a transposition encryption. The program consists of seven files--the main progroam (main.py), four files containig code for the four different encryption ciphers (reverse.py, caesar.py, vigenere.py, transposition.py), and a file containing dictionaries and wordbanks used multiple times throughout the entire program (helper.py).
